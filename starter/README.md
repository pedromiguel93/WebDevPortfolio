# Bootcamp_Week2_Challenge

## Description
In this project, I developed a website portfolio to showcase my own web development projects to show potential clients and employers.
The website is responsive and can easily be accessed either on a computer, tablet or smartphone, adapting to different screensizes.
In this website, I show a current headshot of myself, some of my recent projects, and ways to contact me.
